## Description

This is Hoang Pham's take-home assignment submission repo for Stepful's interview process.

The repo contains the following sub-modules:
- `stepful-platform`: the NextJS front-end for the scheduling platform
- `stepful-scheduler`: the NestJS scheduling API server that will serve data for the UI platform

To run the applicaion, you need to have both modules running at the same time (see each repo's README for further instructions).

To start interacting with the UI platform as either a Coach or Student, go to the following URL: `localhost:3000/user/[a coach or student's user id]`
